README for JGrafchart developers.

Building
========

Building is automated using Apache Ant tasks.
The tasks are specified in build.xml and buildNoCompile.xml for use in a terminal and in Eclipse respectively.

Eclipse
=======

In Eclipse you must also set the environment to refresh after finished Ant jobs (set per Ant build file):

	(Menu) Run - External Tools - External Tools Configuration...
		Refresh tab
			Check Refresh resourced upon completion.
			Select "The entire workspace"

It is also a good idea to globally enable periodic automatic refresh of the Eclipse workspaces:

	(Menu) Window - Preferences - General - Workspace
		Check "Refresh automatically"

To run from Eclipse, create a launcher with:

	Main tab - Main class: grafchart.sfc.Editor
	Arguments tab - VM arguments: -Duser.dir=${project_loc:/BV_JGrafchart}/bin

Warnings in generated code

	Open the special context menu for the Problems view (down arrow to the right) - Configure Contents...
	Configure to show all errors and only warnings in non-generated code by making a custom working set.

Libs
====

Updating external libraries can be far from trivial. All libraries and their
respective versions should be documented in lib/Libs.txt.

xmlBlaster
----------

 * Download and unpack the new release.
 * Create a new distribution jar, i.e. xmlBlasterDist.jar ::
 
     JAVA_HOME=<...> ./build dist

 * Replace JGrafchart's lib/xmlBlaster.jar with the new xmlBlaster distibution jar.
